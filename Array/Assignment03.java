If the number is not found, it will print -1 else it will print the index value of the given  number in the array.
Example 1) If the Array elements are  {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 90, then the output expected is -1.
Example 2)If the Array elements are  {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 56, then the output expected is 3.
